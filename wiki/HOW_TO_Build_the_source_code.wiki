= Introduction =

The source code is divided into three parts: *Patient Client*, *Doctor Client* and *Server*. The whole architecture is shown in [http://code.google.com/p/echelper/#Architecture here].

= Patient Client =

== Environment Requirement in Patient Client ==

 * Windows 8 Consumer Preview
 * Visual Studio 2010 Professional
 * Visual Studio 11 Professional Beta
 * Bing Maps SDK
 * CP210X Driver and ECG Sensor

== Building the Source Code in Patient Client ==

 * Create a new directory named *patient_client*
<code>
mkdir patient_client
</code>
 * Checkout Patient Client source code into *patient_client*
<code>
svn checkout http://atmars.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/patient_client patient_client
</code>
 * Open the *\ECHelper\ECHelper.sln* in Visual Studio 11 Professional Beta, remember to change the developer information in *Project Properties* and the the details in server information.
 * Open the *\ECGNotify\ECGNotify.sln* in Visual Studio 2010 Professional.
 * Plugin the ECG Sensor and run the two projects.

= Doctor Client =

== Environment Requirement in Doctor Client ==

 * Windows 7 Professional
 * Visual Studio 2010 Professional
 * Windows Phone 7 SDK
 * Bing Maps SDK

== Building the Source Code in Doctor Client ==

 * Create a new directory named *doctor_client*
<code>
mkdir doctor_client
</code>
 * Checkout Doctor Client source code into *doctor_client*
<code>
svn checkout http://atmars.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doctor_client doctor_client
</code>
 * Open the *\ECHelper2.0\ECHelper2.0.sln* in Visual Studio 2010 Professional, remember to change the developer information in *Project Properties* and the the details in server information.
 * Run the project.

= Server =

== Environment Requirement in Server ==

 * Windows 7 Professional
 * Visual Studio 2010 Professional
 * Windows Azure SDK
 * Windows Azure Account

== Building the Source Code in Server ==

 * Create a new directory named *server*
<code>
mkdir server
</code>
 * Checkout Server source code into *server*
<code>
svn checkout http://atmars.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/server server
</code>
 * Open the *\ImagineCupCloudServer\ImagineCupCloudServer.sln* in Visual Studio 2010 Professional, remember to change the account information of Windows Azure.
 * Deploy the project in Windows Azure.
